# A quiz about the city Kalmar
A simple but fun game for the person who wants to learn some information about the city Kalmar, placed in the southern part of Sweden. Directly when the user opens the page, they will have the first question displayed for them to answer. When the button is pressed, they will immediately see if the answer is correct or not within an alert box. When that is dismissed they will be able to continue to the next question. At the end there is a summary that shows how many points they got in total.

### Features to ad in the future
- I would love to add even more questions in the future so it will be a longer quiz, but with the amount of time we had for the project, I decided to have three questions to start with at least.

## Tests
- The quiz is tested in different browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla FireFox, Microsoft Edge and on my iPhone.
- The quiz works and shows the correct text for the answers and if none is chosen, it will say that as well to the user.
